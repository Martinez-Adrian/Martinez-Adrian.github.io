# Adrian Martinez's Portfolio

This is my home page! My name is Adrian Martinez and I am a student at Cal State Fullerton and my major is computer science. Here are a few of my favorite labs done in our computer science labs.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
* Lab 4, Part 1
  Writing a program that converts a measurement of volume from milliliters in the metric system, to various units in the US customary system (teaspoons, tablespoons, ounces, and cups). An enjoyable lab at the start of the semester really showed the use and calling of functions in a different place besides the main file. With the help of my partner we were able to solve and address and call the correct functions. Confusing and definintly what taught me personally to think and commit with trial and error for long amounts of time.

* Lab 9, Part 2
  We tested whether the two strings representing the eat-sleep schedule of two philosophers form a valid schedule which seemed like a easy task however, It required some thinking and to be written a specific way. Another 
  enjoyable lab with my partner at the time and required more time than the previous one mentioned. Really did personally like the purpose of this lab to write for two strings.
  
* Lab 10, Part 1
  Writing a function that checks whether a number is prime or not, and you need to write code that reads strings from a file was the task required for this lab part, which was an interesting lab as it was a first time to 
read from .txt files and check with a function. I found it an enjoyable task to read and write and continously fail but find the answer slowly. It really showed the amount of dedication especially something new in the lab to practice.
